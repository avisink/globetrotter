### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Response:
Even though we briefly covered the topics, I felt that the labs and brief activities in class were quite helpful. They emphasized the importance of self-research and learning independently. The flexbox topic, in particular, was challenging for me, but I could easily reference the bug crawl starter demo project we did in class to remind myself how it worked. The topics discussed were very relevant to building the static website for our projects, and I didn't feel unprepared for any specific parts. Instead, I felt more challenged than unprepared overall.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
Response:
If I had more time, I would have focused on improving the email submission form to record submissions effectively. Additionally, I would have added more content, such as a food guide and accommodation guide, and organized them under an "Austin Guide" section instead of just having an events guide. I might have also reconsidered the color scheme; while I like the current one, I believe it could look even better. I would have worked on applying CSS grid more effectively, as it wasn't functioning as expected in my code. Lastly, I would have conducted more in-depth research on media queries. Although I understood them to some extent, much of my work involved trial and error in Chrome DevTools to determine the appropriate edits for each screen size range. I also think my Events Guide page could look much much better. It looks very plain right now, but I will continue to work on it.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Response:
Many aspects of the project demo went well. It had been a long time since I did any web development, so I faced some challenges, especially with CSS. I consider myself more analytical than creative in the arts/design, but the lessons helped me achieve good structures and make them look presentable. However, CSS did not go as planned, and I realized I need more practice. Dariel showed me several shortcuts in VS Code that made my life significantly easier compared to typing everything by hand. I hope to get used to these shortcuts as they are much more efficient, and I look forward to continuing to use them.
