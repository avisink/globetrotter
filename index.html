                <img src="assets/esa.jpg" alt="Esa Cave Interior" style="width:100%; height:auto;">
                <p>Esa Cave, located in Iyin-Ekiti within the Irepodun/Ifelodun LGA, can accommodate around thirty-four thousand people and historically provided 
                    refuge during Yoruba internecine wars. Situated beside a mountain approximately 10,000 feet above sea level, the cave is owned by the Ijoro family 
                    of Okesale, who have lived there for centuries. The cave is about 3 kilometers from Ado-Ekiti, the state capital. 
                    It retains its natural appearance with evidence of long-term use, including demarcated rooms with mud brick walls and small boulders used as pillows by former occupants. 
                    This site offers a rich exploration of Yoruba history.
